### Flaws Identified ⚠️

2. **NO TRANSITIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS**
   - Current: Hard cuts between phrases
   - Problem: Jarring viewer experience
   - Fix: Add crossfade (0.2s) between segments

4. **B-ROLL REPETITION RISK**
   - Current: May use similar clips for related topics
   - Problem: Feels repetitive
   - Fix: Track used clips in batch, avoid reuse

5. **MISSING ENGAGEMENT ELEMENTS**
   - No emoji overlays (trendy)
   - No question prompts mid-video
   - No "wait for it" tension builders

### Recommendations for 10/10

1. ✨ **Ken Burns Effect** - Subtle zoom on B-roll

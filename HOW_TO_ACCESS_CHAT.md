### Option 3: Try to Find Chat in Cursor

Since Cursor doesn't have a "Composer: Open Composer" command, try:

1. **Look in the left sidebar** - there might be a chat/composer icon
2. **Check the bottom panel** - look for tabs like "Chat", "Composer", or "AI"
3. **Look for a chat icon** in the toolbar/status bar
4. **Try right-clicking** in the editor - might have "Open Chat" option
5. **Check View menu** - might have "Show Chat" or "Show Composer"

### Option 4: Create New Chat and Copy Important Parts

If you need to continue the conversation in Cursor:

1. Create a NEW chat in Cursor
2. Open `recovered_chat_readable.txt`
3. Copy the important parts you need
4. Paste into the new chat
5. Continue from there

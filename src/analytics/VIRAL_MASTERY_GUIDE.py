This document contains research-backed techniques for creating viral content.
Use this knowledge to improve video generation prompts and algorithms.

- YouTube algorithm analysis

- Academic research on attention and engagement
- Case studies of viral videos (MrBeast, etc.)

# 1. THE ATTENTION ECONOMY - Understanding the Algorithm
# =============================================================================

ALGORITHM_SECRETS = """
What platforms ACTUALLY optimize for:

1. WATCH TIME (most important)
   - Not just views - total seconds watched
   - A video watched fully by 1000 people beats 10,000 people who scroll past
   - TECHNIQUE: Front-load value, don't save "the good part" for the end

2. RETENTION GRAPH
   - Algorithms analyze WHEN people drop off
   - Spikes in retention = promoted
   - Dips = buried
   - TECHNIQUE: Pattern interrupt every 3-5 seconds

3. ENGAGEMENT VELOCITY
   - How fast do likes/comments come in first hour?
   - Early engagement signals quality
   - TECHNIQUE: Create immediate emotional response

4. COMPLETION RATE
   - % of viewers who watch to end
   - 70%+ completion = algorithm gold
   - TECHNIQUE: Create open loops that must be closed

5. RE-WATCH VALUE
   - Videos watched multiple times get boosted
   - TECHNIQUE: Hidden details, surprising twists, quotable lines

# 3. THE PERFECT VIDEO STRUCTURE - Second by Second
# =============================================================================

PERFECT_SHORT_STRUCTURE = """
THE 30-SECOND VIRAL SHORT BREAKDOWN:

SECOND 0-1: THE HOOK (Pattern Interrupt)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- First frame must be VISUALLY striking
- First word must be ATTENTION-GRABBING
- Creates immediate curiosity gap
- NO slow intros, NO "Hey guys"

TECHNIQUES:
- Start mid-sentence: "...and that's when I realized"
- Shocking claim: "You're eating plastic right now"
- Direct address: "Stop scrolling. This is important."
- Contrarian: "Everything you know about X is wrong"

SECOND 1-3: THE SETUP (Tension Build)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Expand on the hook
- Create anticipation
- First B-roll transition here
- Stakes must be clear

TECHNIQUES:
- Add context: "Most people don't realize..."
- Create stakes: "This could save you thousands..."
- Build anticipation: "What happens next changed everything..."

SECOND 3-15: THE MEAT (Value Delivery)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- THIS IS WHERE MOST VIDEOS FAIL
- Deliver ACTUAL SPECIFIC VALUE
- B-roll changes every 3-5 seconds
- Each sentence adds information

CRITICAL:
❌ "There's a technique you should try..." (vague)
✅ "The 2-minute rule: Any task under 2 minutes, do NOW." (specific)

❌ "Studies show this works..." (empty)
✅ "MIT tested 1,200 students. 73% improved in 2 weeks." (specific)

SECOND 15-23: THE REINFORCEMENT (Drive Home)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Reinforce why this matters to THEM
- Personalize the impact
- Create actionable takeaway

TECHNIQUES:
- "Imagine how your life changes when..."
- "Starting tomorrow, you can..."
- "This is why most people fail..."

SECOND 23-27: THE TWIST (Optional but Powerful)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Unexpected element that creates rewatch
- Challenges what they just learned
- Creates discussion

SECOND 27-30: THE CTA (Engagement Driver)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Ask a question that DEMANDS response
- Not "follow for more" but genuine curiosity
- Creates comment engagement

TECHNIQUES:
✅ "What's YOUR daily money leak?" (personal, easy to answer)
✅ "Type 'me' if you've experienced this" (low friction)
✅ "Comment which one you'd choose" (simple engagement)
"""

# =============================================================================
# 4. VISUAL ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES
# =============================================================================

VISUAL_TECHNIQUES = """
B-ROLL MASTERY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. MATCH THE EMOTION
   - Suspense content → dark, dramatic visuals
   - Inspirational → bright, aspirational imagery
   - Scary facts → unsettling, mysterious footage

2. MATCH THE WORDS
   - When saying "brain" → show brain imagery
   - When saying "money" → show cash/wealth
   - When saying "people" → show crowds/faces
   
3. CHANGE EVERY 3-5 SECONDS
   - Creates rhythm and pace
   - Each change is a mini pattern interrupt
   - Keeps eyes engaged even if audio fades

4. AVOID:
   - Generic "abstract motion" loops
   - Static images
   - Unrelated stock footage
   - Same clip repeating

TEXT OVERLAY MASTERY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. KEY WORDS ONLY
   - Don't transcribe everything
   - Highlight power words: numbers, claims, shocking terms
   
2. PLACEMENT
   - Center for main points
   - Lower third for supporting info
   - Never cover faces

3. TIMING
   - Text appears slightly BEFORE spoken
   - Creates anticipation

COLOR & MOOD:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Dark/desaturated = serious, scary, professional
- Bright/saturated = energetic, fun, motivational
- High contrast = attention-grabbing
- Consistency = professional look
"""

# =============================================================================
# 5. AUDIO ENGINEERING FOR VIRALITY
# =============================================================================

AUDIO_TECHNIQUES = """
VOICE OPTIMIZATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. PACE
   - Faster than normal conversation (1.2-1.4x natural)
   - Creates energy and urgency
   - No dead air

2. DYNAMICS
   - Volume changes on key words
   - Whisper for intimacy → LOUD for impact
   
3. PAUSES
   - Strategic 0.5 second pauses before big reveals
   - Creates anticipation

MUSIC SELECTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. MATCH THE EMOTION
   - Suspense → deep bass, tension builds
   - Motivation → uplifting, crescendo
   - Scary → minor keys, dissonance

2. VOLUME BALANCE
   - Music at 10-15% of voice volume
   - Music dips under key moments
   - Music swells at emotional peaks

3. TRANSITIONS
   - Music changes with B-roll changes
   - Creates cohesive rhythm

SOUND EFFECTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. STRATEGIC USE
   - Whoosh on transitions
   - Ding on key reveals
   - Bass hit on shocking moments

2. NOT OVERUSED
   - Too many effects = cheap/amateur
   - One effect per major moment

PRE_PUBLISH_CHECKLIST = """
Before publishing ANY video, verify:

□ HOOK TEST
  - Does the first second STOP the scroll?
  - Is there a specific, surprising claim?
  - Would YOU stop for this?

□ VALUE TEST
  - What does the viewer LEARN or GAIN?
  - Is it SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE?
  - Could they explain it to a friend?

□ PROMISE-PAYOFF TEST
  - Does every promise get delivered?
  - No "learn now" without teaching
  - No "secret" without revealing

□ SPECIFICITY TEST
  - Are there NUMBERS in the content?
  - Are there SPECIFIC examples?
  - Is it vague or concrete?

□ EMOTIONAL TEST
  - What emotion does this trigger?
  - Is it strong enough to share?
  - Does it create discussion?

□ VISUAL TEST
  - Does B-roll match the words?
  - Are transitions smooth?
  - Is there visual variety?

□ AUDIO TEST
  - Is narration engaging?
  - Does music enhance the mood?
  - Are sound effects purposeful?

□ CTA TEST
  - Is the ending question engaging?
  - Easy to answer = more comments
  - Creates discussion = algorithm boost

## CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

```
[!] gemini failed: 404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta
```

**The cached Gemini model `gemini-1.5-flash` is NOT AVAILABLE anymore!**

The dynamic model discovery found `gemini-3-flash-preview` but the fallback list still contains the old model name.

**Impact:** Many AI calls failed and fell back to OpenRouter, which may have affected enhancement quality.

---

## RECOMMENDATION

1. **Fix Gemini model cache** - Clear stale cache with old model names
2. **Verify all 341 applied** - Run with working quota to confirm
3. **Test upload mode** - Some enhancements only work with actual uploads
